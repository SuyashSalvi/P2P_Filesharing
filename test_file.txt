# Test File for File Chunking Module
# ----------------------------------
# This file is used to test the functionality of the File Chunking module in the P2P File Sharing project.
# It contains text content that can be split into chunks using the `splitFile` function and reassembled
# using the `assembleChunks` function (if implemented).

# Purpose:
# --------
# 1. Validate the ability to read files in binary mode.
# 2. Test the correct division of file content into fixed-size chunks.
# 3. Provide a known sample file for debugging and validation.
# 4. Serve as a template for testing file reconstruction from chunks.

# Usage:
# ------
# - Place this file in the working directory of the program.
# - Adjust the chunk size in the test program (`test_file_chunking.cpp`) as needed.
# - Run the test program to observe the number of chunks created and their sizes.

# Applications:
# -------------
# - The file mimics real-world file-sharing use cases.
# - It is lightweight and easy to extend for additional test scenarios.
# - Developers can modify its content to test edge cases like:
#   - Very large files.
#   - Empty files.
#   - Files with non-text binary data (e.g., images, videos).

# Content Starts Below:
This is a test file for validating the file chunking functionality.
It contains multiple lines of text to simulate a real file.
Feel free to add more content to this file to make the test case more robust.

Line 1: Hello, world!
Line 2: This is a second line of text.
Line 3: Hereâ€™s another line to test the chunking process.
Line 4: End of test file.
